# Daytripper

Daytripper is a travel planning app that allows users to discover and organize daily excursions. Search for destinations on an interactive map, bookmark locations, and find nearby accommodations, attractions, and restaurants. 

## Key Features

- Drop pins on the map to mark points of interest or trip destinations
- Discover nearby lodging, tourist attractions, eateries based on pinned locations  
- View lists of mapped locations with names, ratings, and other details
- Store planned trips and mapped locations to view later
